# Vigenere Cipher
  - Successfully Encrypt and Decrypt a String using the Vigenere Cipher

# How it works
  - Input a file
  - You will receive a new copy of that file that is Encrypted
  - If you input the Encrypted file
  - You will decrypt the string

# To Run
  - Execute.java is the runnable file

# What I learned
